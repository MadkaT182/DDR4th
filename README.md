#Original readme
Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix

Original theme by PatrickIIDX  | Port by AJ 187/SSC
[Version: Beta 2/201109xx]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==[Introduction]================================================================
One day, I got bored and decided to port PatrickIIDX's DDR 5th Mix from
StepMania 3.9 to sm-ssc. This happened before Katze asked for my help in porting
DDR Forever to sm-ssc. The experience with DDR Forever helped out the 5th Mix
theme, and vice versa. :)

Surprisingly, the development of Selling Out Made Simple 2 has helped this
port of DDR 5th Mix. Go figure.

==[Notes]=======================================================================
This theme requires StepMania 5 Preview 1a or better to function properly.

This theme isn't complete. There are things that have yet to be fixed.
Some things I know about, some I don't.

Like pretty much any other theme I deal with, there's some caveats.

1) It's optimized for CoinMode_Home with Event Mode turned on.
That doesn't mean it accurately simulates 5th Mix CS's Event Mode yet, nor does
that mean that the other two coin modes are completely unsupported.

2) StepMania Online is not (fully) supported yet.
I started doing some work on it, but it's nowhere near done.

This theme does not take Extra Stage into account, unlike PatrickIIDX's theme.
There are no plans to support Extra Stage at this time.

There are a lot of things I still have to do in the theme.
todo.txt catalogues some of them.

==[Known Issues]================================================================
Japanese fonts could be better. They have been worked on a little bit.

DifficultyList/StepsDisplayList likes to be a jerk about the number of charts
it shows on first load. In addition, the cursor and frames don't always match
up when you're not on a song. (e.g. Maniac, Basic, Trick)
I have no idea how to fix these two issues at the moment.

TextBanners aren't optimal when it comes to subtitles yet. This will be fixed.
Card support is an optional feature that may or may not get implemented. (I'd
rather have the Lua transforms be perfect for all situations as to make
near-accurate 5th Mix Cards.)
* glossary note: "Card" is the equivalent of the TextBanner in StepMania.
DDR games used pre-made textures for this, which is why they could put whatever
they want in them.
(Some simulators [none of them mainstream] actually support this natively!)

ScreenEvaluation takes a while to come up the first time. I don't know why
this is, either. It seems to be a bug on sm-ssc's end, as it happens with a
bunch of themes that I use.

==[Changelog]===================================================================
(see changelog.txt)

==[License]=====================================================================
There is no license. You can do what you wish with this theme, hopefully giving
credit to PatrickIIDX and myself (for the metrics and Lua, respectively), though
not required. All we ask is that you don't use this to make a bootleg DDR 5th Mix,
since that'd be a terrible thing.

There is no warranty, I am not liable if things go wrong, etc. Covering my bases.

==[Thanks]======================================================================
PatrickIIDX, for giving me permission to use his theme as a base.
k0ld, for various graphics (HD LifeMeter shape)
SSC, for being SSC.
Renard, for the letterboxing idea and testing.
Koizumi, for testing.
tweak, for testing.
Katze, for being Katze. (It's not always a bad thing, you know. :D)
Everyone who used sm-ssc and uses StepMania 5.

==[No Thanks]===================================================================
People who want the community to stagnate forever by using StepMania 3.9 and 3.95.
(OpenITG doesn't count here; it's being actively developed.)
